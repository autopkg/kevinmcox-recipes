These recipes are a fork from [Rich Trouton](https://github.com/autopkg/rtrouton-recipes/tree/master/AdobeCreativeCloud) and are what I consider to be optimized versions for use with Munki.

The same parent recipe can be used for either Apple Silicon or Intel Macs by changing the ARCH variable.

The `XMLReader` processor used by the download recipe was originally written by [Tyler Riti](https://github.com/triti).
