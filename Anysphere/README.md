# Cursor CLI

https://cursor.com/cli

No pre-packaged releases are provided for Cursor CLI with the only install method being to curl down a script and pipe it to bash.

This recipe uses the install script to find the version and download URL.
https://cursor.com/install

Then it builds a package to install in /usr/bin/ instead of the user's home directory.

## NOTE

I do not currently use Cursor CLI so have not tested this installation method exstensively. Please let me know if you experience any issues.
